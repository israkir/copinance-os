# the achievable coverage values for this catalog: full data 1.000, missing the
# dollar-notional P/C ratio 0.837, missing deltas 0.860, missing all greeks 0.698,
# missing greeks and dollar notional 0.535, missing all OI 0.488 — 0.60 cleanly

# Decision Lens and the positioning matrix agree on how confident a read must be
# before it is asserted rather than called neutral. Unlike combine.py's edge (which
# is bounded to [-1, 1]), the bias score is an unbounded weighted log-odds sum, so
# the threshold is expressed on that scale: 0.30 corresponds to sigmoid(0.30) ≈ 57.4%
# on the two-way read — a starting value to be recalibrated from positioning_outcomes
# once samples accrue.
