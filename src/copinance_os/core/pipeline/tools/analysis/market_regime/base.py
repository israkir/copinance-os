"""Base classes and interfaces for market regime detection tools.

This module provides common abstractions for different regime detection methodologies,
allowing rule-based and statistical methods to share a consistent interface.

Pure numeric helpers live in ``copinance_os.domain.indicators``; pipeline tools import
