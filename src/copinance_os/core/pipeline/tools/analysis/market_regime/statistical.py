"""Statistical market regime detection tools.

This module provides statistical methods for regime detection using:
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for regime inference
- Hamilton Regime Switching Models
- Bayesian regime detection
- Other statistical inference methods

These methods infer regimes probabilistically rather than using rule-based thresholds.
