# Market Regime Detection Tools

Market regime detection tools identify different market conditions and phases, helping investors understand the current state of a stock and make informed decisions. These tools are part of the [Analysis Tools](../index) suite.

## Overview

Market regimes represent distinct periods characterized by different statistical properties, trends, and behaviors. Identifying these regimes is crucial for:

- **Risk Management**: Adjusting position sizes based on volatility regimes
- **Strategy Selection**: Choosing appropriate strategies for different market phases
- **Timing Decisions**: Identifying optimal entry and exit points
- **Portfolio Allocation**: Adapting asset allocation to market conditions

## Detection Methods

Copinance OS supports multiple methodologies for regime detection:

### Rule-Based Detection (Current Implementation)

Rule-based tools use technical indicators, moving averages, and threshold-based logic. These are fast, interpretable, and work well for most use cases.

**Available Tools:**
- Trend Detection (MA crossovers, momentum)
- Volatility Detection (rolling volatility with thresholds)
- Cycle Detection (Wyckoff methodology)
- Market Regime Indicators (VIX, market breadth, sector rotation)

### Statistical Inference (Future)

Statistical methods will use probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Hamilton Regime Switching Models for more sophisticated regime inference.

**Planned Tools:**
- HMM-based regime detection
- Hamilton Regime Switching Models
- Bayesian regime detection

**Usage:**
```python
# Rule-based tools (default, current)
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis import create_market_regime_tools
tools = create_market_regime_tools(provider)

# Or explicitly specify rule-based
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis.market_regime.registry import (
    create_regime_tools_by_type,
)
rule_tools = create_regime_tools_by_type(provider, "rule_based")

# Statistical tools (when implemented)
stat_tools = create_regime_tools_by_type(provider, "statistical")

# Get all available tools
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis.market_regime.registry import (
    create_all_regime_tools,
)
all_tools = create_all_regime_tools(provider, methods=["rule_based", "statistical"])
```

## Rule-Based Tools

### 1. Trend Detection Tool (`detect_market_trend`)

**Method**: Rule-based using moving averages and momentum indicators

Detects market trend regimes (bull, bear, or neutral) using moving averages and price momentum.

**Methodology Improvements:**
- **Log-Returns**: Uses log-returns (r<sub>t</sub> = ln(P<sub>t</sub> / P<sub>t-1</sub>)) instead of simple returns for:
  - Better statistical properties (additivity, symmetry)
  - Improved handling of high-volatility stocks (e.g., MSTR, crypto-related stocks)
  - More accurate multi-period calculations
- **Volatility-Scaled Thresholds**: Replaces hard thresholds (±5%, ±20%) with volatility-scaled momentum:
  - AdjMomentum = log_return / σ
  - Thresholds: ±0.25σ (medium confidence), ±1.0σ (high confidence)
  - Prevents penalizing low-volatility stocks while maintaining sensitivity for high-volatility stocks

**Parameters:**
- `symbol` (required): Stock ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL', 'MSFT')
- `lookback_days` (optional, default: 200): Number of days to analyze
- `short_ma_period` (optional, default: 50): Short-term moving average period in days
- `long_ma_period` (optional, default: 200): Long-term moving average period in days

**Returns:**
- `regime`: Classification ("bull", "bear", or "neutral")
- `confidence`: Confidence level ("high", "medium", or "low")
- `current_price`: Current stock price
- `price_change_pct`: Log-return as percentage over the period (for display)
- `log_return`: Raw log-return value (r_t = ln(P_t / P_0))
- `volatility_scaled_momentum`: Momentum scaled by volatility (AdjMomentum = log_return / σ)
- `recent_volatility`: Recent volatility (annualized, as percentage)
- `momentum_20d_pct`: 20-day momentum percentage (using log-returns)
- `short_ma`: Current short-term moving average value
- `long_ma`: Current long-term moving average value
- `ma_relationship`: Relationship between MAs ("bullish", "bearish", or "neutral")
- `parameters_adjusted`: Boolean indicating if parameters were adapted for limited data
- `methodology`: "log_returns_with_volatility_scaling"

**Example:**
```python
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis import MarketRegimeDetectTrendTool
from copinanceos.infrastructure.data_providers import YFinanceMarketProvider

provider = YFinanceMarketProvider()
tool = MarketRegimeDetectTrendTool(provider)
result = await tool.execute(symbol="AAPL", lookback_days=200)

if result.success:
    print(f"Regime: {result.data['regime']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.data['confidence']}")
```

### 2. Volatility Regime Detection Tool (`detect_volatility_regime`)

**Method**: Rule-based using rolling volatility with statistical thresholds

Detects volatility regimes (high, normal, or low) using rolling volatility analysis.

**Why Rolling Volatility vs GARCH:**
While GARCH models are theoretically superior, we use rolling volatility because:
- **More stable** on individual stocks (GARCH can be unstable)
- **Easier to explain** and interpret for users
- **Less prone to overfitting** on retail investment horizons
- **Robust and reliable** for practical applications

**Current Implementation:**
- Rolling volatility using log-returns (simple moving average)
- Classification using μ ± σ thresholds

**Future Improvements:**
- **EWMA Volatility** (RiskMetrics style): More responsive to recent changes
  - Formula: σ²<sub>t</sub> = λ * σ²<sub>t-1</sub> + (1 - λ) * r²<sub>t</sub>
  - Decay factor λ = 0.94 for daily data (RiskMetrics standard)
- **Percentile-Based Regimes**: More robust to outliers
  - Top 80% → High volatility
  - Bottom 20% → Low volatility
  - Middle → Normal volatility

**Parameters:**
- `symbol` (required): Stock ticker symbol
- `lookback_days` (optional, default: 252): Number of days to analyze (typically 1 trading year)
- `volatility_window` (optional, default: 20): Window size for volatility calculation in days

**Returns:**
- `regime`: Classification ("high", "normal", or "low")
- `current_volatility`: Current volatility as percentage
- `mean_volatility`: Mean volatility over the period
- `max_volatility`: Maximum volatility observed
- `min_volatility`: Minimum volatility observed
- `volatility_percentile`: Current volatility percentile
- `parameters_adjusted`: Boolean indicating if parameters were adapted

**Example:**
```python
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis import MarketRegimeDetectVolatilityTool

tool = MarketRegimeDetectVolatilityTool(provider)
result = await tool.execute(symbol="AAPL", lookback_days=252)

if result.success:
    print(f"Volatility Regime: {result.data['regime']}")
    print(f"Current Volatility: {result.data['current_volatility']}%")
```

**Academic Foundation:**
- **Andersen & Bollerslev (1998)**: Answering the Skeptics: Yes, Standard Volatility Models Do Provide Accurate Forecasts. International Economic Review, 39(4), 885-905. Validates the use of realized volatility models for forecasting.
- **RiskMetrics Technical Document (J.P. Morgan, 1996)**: Provides the methodology for rolling volatility calculations with annualization for daily data.

**How It Works:**
The tool calculates rolling volatility as the standard deviation of **log-returns** over a specified window. Volatility is annualized assuming 252 trading days per year.

**Current Classification (μ ± σ):**
Regime classification is based on statistical deviation from the historical mean:
- **High**: Current volatility > mean + 1 standard deviation
- **Low**: Current volatility < mean - 1 standard deviation
- **Normal**: Within one standard deviation of the mean

**Future: Percentile-Based Classification:**
A more robust alternative using percentiles:
- **High**: Current volatility ≥ 80th percentile
- **Low**: Current volatility ≤ 20th percentile
- **Normal**: Between 20th and 80th percentile

The percentile-based approach is more robust to outliers and provides clearer regime boundaries.

### 3. Market Cycle Detection Tool (`detect_market_cycles`)

**Method**: Rule-based using Wyckoff methodology

Detects market cycles and regime transitions, identifying accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown phases.

**Parameters:**
- `symbol` (required): Stock ticker symbol
- `lookback_days` (optional, default: 252): Number of days to analyze

**Returns:**
- `current_phase`: Cycle phase ("accumulation", "markup", "distribution", "markdown", or "transition")
- `phase_description`: Human-readable description of the phase
- `price_position_pct`: Current price position within the period's range (0-100%)
- `volume_ratio`: Recent volume relative to average volume
- `current_price`: Current stock price
- `ma_20`: 20-day moving average value
- `ma_50`: 50-day moving average value
- `recent_trend`: Short-term trend direction
- `longer_trend`: Longer-term trend direction
- `potential_regime_change`: Boolean indicating potential regime transition
- `parameters_adjusted`: Boolean indicating if parameters were adapted

**Example:**
```python
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis import MarketRegimeDetectCyclesTool

tool = MarketRegimeDetectCyclesTool(provider)
result = await tool.execute(symbol="AAPL", lookback_days=252)

if result.success:
    print(f"Current Phase: {result.data['current_phase']}")
    print(f"Description: {result.data['phase_description']}")
    print(f"Regime Change Signal: {result.data['potential_regime_change']}")
```

provider = YFinanceMarketProvider()
tool = MarketRegimeIndicatorsTool(provider)

# Get all indicators
result = await tool.execute(market_index="SPY", lookback_days=252)

if result.success:
    # VIX data
    if result.data.get("vix", {}).get("available"):
        print(f"Current VIX: {result.data['vix']['current_vix']}")
        print(f"VIX Regime: {result.data['vix']['regime']}")
        print(f"Market Sentiment: {result.data['vix']['sentiment']}")

        print(f"Lagging Sectors: {[s['name'] for s in rotation['lagging_sectors']]}")

# Get only VIX data
vix_result = await tool.execute(include_market_breadth=False, include_sector_rotation=False)
```

**Use Cases:**

1. **Risk Assessment**: VIX levels help assess overall market risk and fear levels
2. **Market Health**: Market breadth indicates whether market moves are broad-based or narrow
3. **Sector Allocation**: Sector rotation signals help identify which sectors to overweight/underweight
4. **Regime Confirmation**: Use alongside individual stock regime tools to confirm broader market context

**Interpretation Guide:**

**VIX Levels:**
- **VIX &lt; 15**: Low volatility, complacent market. Often precedes volatility spikes.
- **VIX 15-25**: Normal volatility range. Healthy market conditions.
- **VIX 25-30**: Elevated fear. Market stress, potential buying opportunities for contrarians.
- **VIX &gt; 30**: Panic levels. Extreme fear, often marks market bottoms.

**Market Breadth:**
- **Strong Breadth (≥70%)**: Healthy market with broad participation. Bull markets typically show strong breadth.
- **Moderate Breadth (40-70%)**: Mixed signals. Some sectors leading, others lagging.
- **Weak Breadth (&lt;40%)**: Narrow market. Few sectors driving gains, potential weakness ahead.

**Sector Rotation Themes:**
- **Defensive Rotation**: Utilities and staples leading. Often occurs during market uncertainty or downturns.
- **Growth Rotation**: Technology and discretionary leading. Typical in risk-on environments and bull markets.
- **Value Rotation**: Financials and industrials leading. Often signals economic recovery or reflation.
- **Mixed Rotation**: No clear theme. Market in transition or uncertain phase.

**Data Sources:**
- All data is fetched using free sources via the yfinance provider
- VIX: CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX)
- Market Breadth: 11 sector ETFs (XLK, XLE, XLI, XLV, XLF, XLP, XLY, XLU, XLB, XLC, XLRE)
- Sector Rotation: Same sector ETFs with momentum analysis

**Note:** This tool analyzes market-wide indicators, not individual stocks. Use it in combination with individual stock regime detection tools for comprehensive analysis.

## Adaptive Data Handling

All market regime detection tools include adaptive parameter adjustment for stocks with limited trading history. This is particularly important for:

- **Newly listed stocks**: IPOs and recent listings
- **Low-volume stocks**: Stocks with irregular trading
- **International stocks**: May have different trading calendars

**How It Works:**
- Tools automatically adjust moving average periods and analysis windows based on available data
- Minimum data requirements are enforced (10-20 data points depending on the tool)
- Results include a `parameters_adjusted` flag and explanatory notes when adaptation occurs
- Confidence levels are adjusted to reflect data limitations

**Example:**
```python
result = await tool.execute(symbol="NEWLY_LISTED", lookback_days=200)

if result.data.get('parameters_adjusted'):
    print(f"Note: {result.data.get('note')}")
    print(f"Adjusted parameters used: {result.data.get('short_ma_period_used')}/{result.data.get('long_ma_period_used')}")
```

## Using Tools in Workflows

### Agentic Workflows

Tools are automatically available in agentic workflows when a market data provider is configured:

```bash
copinance research ask AAPL "What is the current market trend and volatility regime?"
```

The LLM will automatically use the appropriate tools to answer your question.

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis import (
    create_market_regime_tools,
    MarketRegimeIndicatorsTool,
)
from copinanceos.infrastructure.data_providers import YFinanceMarketProvider

# Create rule-based detection tools
provider = YFinanceMarketProvider()
tools = create_market_regime_tools(provider)

# Use individual detection tools
trend_tool = tools[0]
result = await trend_tool.execute(symbol="AAPL")

# Create and use indicators tool
indicators_tool = MarketRegimeIndicatorsTool(provider)
indicators_result = await indicators_tool.execute(market_index="SPY")
```

### Tool Registry

Tools can also be registered in a tool registry for centralized management:

```python
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools import ToolRegistry
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis import create_market_regime_tools

registry = ToolRegistry()
tools = create_market_regime_tools(provider)
registry.register_many(tools)

# Get a tool by name
trend_tool = registry.get("detect_market_trend")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure sufficient historical data for reliable regime detection
2. **Multiple Timeframes**: Use different lookback periods to confirm regime signals
3. **Combined Analysis**: Use all tools together for comprehensive market assessment:
   - Individual stock tools (trend, volatility, cycles) for stock-specific analysis
   - Market indicators tool for broader market context
4. **Confidence Levels**: Pay attention to confidence indicators, especially with limited data
5. **Regime Transitions**: Monitor `potential_regime_change` signals for early warning of shifts
6. **Adaptive Parameters**: Be aware when parameters are adjusted and interpret results accordingly
7. **Market Context**: Always consider market-wide indicators when analyzing individual stocks

## Limitations

- **Historical Data Dependency**: Tools require sufficient historical data for accurate detection
- **Market-Specific**: Results may vary across different markets and asset classes
- **Lagging Indicators**: Moving averages and volatility are lagging indicators
- **False Signals**: No tool is perfect; combine with other analysis methods
- **Data Quality**: Results depend on the quality of data from the underlying provider

## Package Structure & Extensibility

The market regime detection tools are organized in a modular structure to support multiple detection methodologies and future extensions.

### Current Structure

```
infrastructure/tools/analysis/market_regime/
├── __init__.py          # Public API exports (backward compatible)
├── base.py              # Common interfaces and base classes
├── rule_based.py        # Rule-based detection (current implementation)
├── indicators.py        # Market regime indicators (VIX, breadth, rotation)
├── statistical.py       # Statistical inference (future: HMM, Hamilton models)
└── registry.py          # Factory functions for unified tool creation
```

### Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each detection method is in its own module
2. **Common Interface**: All tools implement the `Tool` interface via `BaseRegimeDetectionTool`
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new methods without breaking existing code
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work with default imports

### Adding New Detection Methods

To add a new detection method (e.g., machine learning-based):

1. **Create a new module** (e.g., `machine_learning.py`):
```python
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis.market_regime.base import (
    BaseRegimeDetectionTool,
)

class MLRegimeDetectionTool(BaseRegimeDetectionTool):
    def get_detection_method(self) -> str:
        return "machine_learning"
    
    async def _detect_regime(self, symbol: str, **kwargs: Any) -> dict[str, Any]:
        # Your ML-based detection logic
        pass
    
    async def _execute_impl(self, **kwargs: Any) -> ToolResult:
        # Implementation
        pass
```

2. **Add factory function**:
```python
def create_ml_regime_tools(provider: MarketDataProvider) -> list[Tool]:
    return [MLRegimeDetectionTool(provider)]
```

3. **Update `registry.py`** to include the new method in `create_all_regime_tools()`

4. **Update `__init__.py`** to export the new tools

### Using Different Methods

```python
# Rule-based tools (default, current)
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis import (
    create_market_regime_tools,
    MarketRegimeIndicatorsTool,
)
tools = create_market_regime_tools(provider)

# Market regime indicators tool (separate from detection tools)
indicators_tool = MarketRegimeIndicatorsTool(provider)

# Explicitly specify method type
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis.market_regime.registry import (
    create_regime_tools_by_type,
)
rule_tools = create_regime_tools_by_type(provider, "rule_based")
stat_tools = create_regime_tools_by_type(provider, "statistical")  # When implemented

# Get all available tools from multiple methods
from copinanceos.infrastructure.tools.analysis.market_regime.registry import (
    create_all_regime_tools,
)
all_tools = create_all_regime_tools(
    provider, 
    methods=["rule_based", "statistical"]  # Add more as they're implemented
)
# Note: MarketRegimeIndicatorsTool is separate and must be created explicitly
```

### Future Extensions

The structure is designed to accommodate:
- **Statistical Methods**: Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Hamilton Regime Switching Models
- **Machine Learning**: LSTM, transformers, ensemble methods
- **Real-time Detection**: Streaming regime detection
- **Multi-asset**: Cross-asset regime correlation
- **Probabilistic Models**: Bayesian inference, transition probabilities
