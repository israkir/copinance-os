# Quick Start

Get started with Copinance OS in 5 minutes.

## Your First Research

### 1. Search for a Stock

```bash
copinance stock search "Apple"
```

This will show you matching stocks with their symbols.

### 2. Run a Static Workflow

```bash
copinance research run AAPL --workflow stock
```

This performs a comprehensive stock workflow with:
- Current market quote
- Historical price data
- Fundamental analysis
- Key metrics and trends

### 3. View Results

The results are displayed in the terminal with:
- Stock information
- Current quote
- Price trends
- Fundamental metrics
- Analysis summary

## Using Agentic Workflows

For AI-powered analysis, you need to set up a Gemini API key first.

### 1. Get API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Sign in and create an API key
3. Copy the key

### 2. Configure

Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
COPINANCEOS_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 3. Ask a Question

```bash
copinance research ask AAPL "What is the current price and P/E ratio?"
```

The AI will analyze the stock and answer your question using available data.

## Working with Profiles

Profiles let you customize research output based on your financial literacy level.

### Automatic Profile Prompting

When you run research commands without a profile, the system will automatically prompt you to set your financial literacy level for more personalized analysis results. You can:
- Choose to create a profile with your literacy level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced)
- Decline and continue with default settings

### Create a Profile Manually

You can also create a profile manually:

```bash
copinance profile create --literacy intermediate --name "My Profile"
```

### Use Profile in Research

```bash
copinance research run AAPL --workflow stock --profile-id \<profile-id\>
```

Or simply use your current profile (set with `profile set-current`).

## Common Workflows

### Quick Analysis
```bash
# Static workflow (no API key needed)
copinance research run AAPL --workflow stock

# Agentic workflow (requires API key)
copinance research ask AAPL "Analyze this stock for me"
```

### Research Management

Copinance OS provides three commands for research:

- **`run`** - Quick one-off analysis (creates and executes in one command)
- **`create`** - Create research task for later execution
- **`execute`** - Execute existing research (can be run multiple times)

```bash
# Quick analysis (creates and executes)
copinance research run AAPL --workflow stock

# Create research for later
copinance research create AAPL --workflow stock

## Macro Regime Dashboard

Get a comprehensive view of market conditions and macroeconomic indicators:

```bash
# Full analysis with defaults (SPY, 252 days, all indicators)
copinance research macro

# Custom index and lookback period
copinance research macro --market-index QQQ --lookback-days 180

# Only macro indicators (rates, credit, commodities, labor, housing, manufacturing, consumer, global, advanced)
copinance research macro \
  --no-include-vix \
  --no-include-market-breadth \
  --no-include-sector-rotation

# Advanced macro analysis (include all economic indicators)
copinance research macro \
  --include-labor \
  --include-housing \
  --include-manufacturing \
  --include-consumer \
  --include-global \
  --include-advanced
```

See [Workflows](../user-guide/workflows#macro-regime-workflow) for all customization options.

# Execute existing research
copinance research execute \<research-id\>

# View research results
copinance research get \<research-id\>
```

**Why separate commands?** `create` lets you prepare research tasks in advance or batch process multiple stocks. `execute` allows re-running the same research with different contexts or questions. `run` is a convenience for quick analysis. See [CLI Reference](../user-guide/cli) for details.
