# Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the Copinance OS project.

## Project Mission

Copinance OS aims to democratize financial research by providing an open-source, extensible framework that makes institutional-grade stock research accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial resources or technical expertise.

See our [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) for the complete vision.

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Early Development (v0.1.x - Alpha)

As an early-stage project, we are currently establishing our governance structure. This document will evolve as the community grows.

## Core Principles

1. **Openness**: All discussions, decisions, and development happen in public
2. **Meritocracy**: Contributions and commitment earn influence
3. **Transparency**: Decision-making processes are documented and visible
4. **Inclusivity**: Everyone is welcome to contribute, regardless of background
5. **Quality**: We maintain high standards for code, documentation, and community interactions
6. **Mission-Driven**: All decisions align with democratizing financial research

## Decision Making

### Consensus Building

We prefer **lazy consensus** for most decisions:

1. **Proposal**: Someone proposes an idea (issue, discussion, or PR)
2. **Discussion**: Community discusses the proposal
3. **Refinement**: Proposal is refined based on feedback
4. **Approval**: If no objections after 72 hours, proposal is accepted

**Objections must be constructive** and include:
- Clear explanation of concerns
- Suggested alternatives or modifications
- Alignment with project mission

### Voting

When consensus cannot be reached, we use voting:

#### Types of Votes

**Technical Decisions** (architecture, major features):
- **Who votes**: Committers and Maintainers
- **Threshold**: 2/3 majority
- **Example**: "Should we adopt GraphQL for the API?"

**Governance Decisions** (roles, policies):
- **Who votes**: Maintainers only
- **Threshold**: Simple majority (51%)
- **Example**: "Should we add a new committer?"

**Critical Decisions** (license change, fork, major pivots):
- **Who votes**: Maintainers only
- **Threshold**: Unanimous (100%)
- **Example**: "Should we change the license?"

#### Voting Process

1. **Proposal**: Clear written proposal with rationale
2. **Discussion Period**: Minimum 7 days for discussion
3. **Call for Vote**: Explicit call for vote with clear options
4. **Voting Period**: 7 days minimum
5. **Result**: Announced publicly with vote tally

### Fast-Track Decisions

Some decisions can be made quickly:

- **Bug fixes**: Can be merged immediately
- **Documentation fixes**: Can be merged immediately
- **Dependencies updates**: Can be merged after CI passes
- **Minor refactoring**: Can be merged with one approving review

## Areas of Decision Making

### Architecture Decisions

**Who Decides**: Maintainers with input from committers

**Process**:
1. Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `docs/adr/`
2. Discuss for minimum 7 days
3. Vote if no consensus

**Recent ADRs**: (To be populated)

### Roadmap and Priorities

**Who Decides**: Maintainers with community input

**Process**:
1. Community discussions on priorities
2. Maintainers synthesize into roadmap
3. Published quarterly in `ROADMAP.md`

### Release Management

**Who Decides**: Maintainers

**Process**:
- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Release notes required for all releases
- Security releases can skip normal discussion period

**Release Cadence**:
- **Major** (X.0.0): When breaking changes accumulate (no fixed schedule)
- **Minor** (0.X.0): Monthly or when significant features are ready
- **Patch** (0.0.X): As needed for bug fixes and security issues

### Code Review

**All code must be reviewed before merging**, except:
- Documentation typo fixes
- Emergency security patches (must be reviewed post-merge)

**Review Requirements**:
- **Normal PRs**: 1 approving review from committer/maintainer
- **Breaking changes**: 2 approving reviews, one from maintainer
- **Security fixes**: 1 review from maintainer
- **CI must pass**: All automated checks must be green

### Code of Conduct Enforcement

**Who Decides**: Maintainers

**Process**:
1. Report received (private or public)
2. Maintainers discuss privately
3. Decision made within 48 hours for urgent issues

## Communication Channels

### Public Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, tasks
- **GitHub Discussions**: Questions, ideas, general discussion
- **GitHub Pull Requests**: Code review and technical discussion
- **Discord/Slack**: (To be set up) Real-time community chat

### Private Channels

- **Security Issues**: Via GitHub Security Advisories or security@copinance-os.org
- **Code of Conduct**: Via maintainers@copinance-os.org
- **Maintainer Discussions**: Private maintainer channel (for sensitive topics only)

**Default to Public**: Only use private channels for security issues, CoC violations, or personal matters.

## Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise:

1. **Direct Communication**: Parties try to resolve directly
2. **Mediation**: Involve a neutral committer or maintainer
3. **Maintainer Decision**: Maintainers make final call if unresolved
4. **Project Lead**: Project lead makes final decision if maintainers are split

All parties must:
- Assume good intentions
- Focus on what's best for the project
- Respect the Code of Conduct
- Accept final decisions gracefully

## Changes to Governance

This governance document can be modified through:

1. **Proposal**: PR proposing changes to GOVERNANCE.md
2. **Discussion**: Minimum 14 days for community input
3. **Vote**: Unanimous approval by maintainers required
4. **Announcement**: Changes announced to community
